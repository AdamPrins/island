# island
This is a hobby project that will be looking into island generation using random points and Delaunay triangulation.
Currently produces tiles with some color purmutations. 

There are toggles for the points, triangle outlines, and the Circumcircles. \
There are a couple diffrent distribution options. \
Ocean and coastal points can be generated
